You are creating a concise summary of a research paper chapter for context continuity.

## Chapter Title
{{ chapter_title }}

## Chapter Content
{{ content }}

## Your Task

Create a **{{ max_words }}-word summary** of this chapter that captures:

1. **Main Argument/Focus**: The central point or argument of the chapter
2. **Key Findings/Claims**: The most important findings, claims, or evidence presented
3. **Methodology/Approach**: If applicable, how the topic was analyzed
4. **Connection to Thesis**: How this chapter supports the paper's overall thesis

## Requirements

- **Maximum {{ max_words }} words** - be extremely concise
- Focus on WHAT was established, not HOW it was written
- Include specific findings, not vague statements
- Mention any key terms or concepts introduced
- Note any important citations or evidence referenced

Do NOT:
- Use bullet points
- Include meta-commentary (e.g., "This chapter discusses...")
- Exceed {{ max_words }} words
- Include citations in the summary

DO:
