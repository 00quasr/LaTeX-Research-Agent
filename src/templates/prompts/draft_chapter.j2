## CRITICAL Instructions for Comprehensive Writing

### Length and Depth Requirements
- **Target: {{ target_words }} words** - this is a substantial chapter
- Each key point should be developed into 2-4 substantial paragraphs
- Do NOT be superficial - this is a comprehensive academic paper
- Include detailed explanations, examples, and analysis
- Each section within this chapter needs thorough treatment

### Content Structure
1. **Chapter Opening**: Strong introduction establishing the chapter's focus and connection to previous material
2. **Section Development**: Each section gets comprehensive treatment:
   - Explain concepts and ideas in detail
   - Provide specific examples, case studies, or evidence
   - Include relevant data, statistics, or research findings
   - Analyze implications and connections to the thesis
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Clear connections between sections and ideas
4. **Chapter Closing**: Summarize key points and transition to what comes next

### Visual Element Descriptions
When including figures, tables, or charts, use this format:

**[FIGURE X: Title]**
Caption: Detailed description of the figure
Description: What the figure shows and why it's important

**[TABLE X: Title]**
Caption: Description of the table
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data     | Data     | Data     |

**[CHART X: Title]**
Caption: Description of the chart
Type: bar/line/pie/scatter
Data: Description of data points and trends

### Citation Guidelines
- Include citations in format [AuthorYear] throughout
- Cite sources for statistics, claims, and research findings
- Aim for 10-20 citations per chapter
- Examples:
  - "Research by [Smith2023] demonstrates that..."
  - "According to industry analysis [Johnson2022], the market grew by..."
  - "Several studies [Brown2021; Davis2022; Wilson2023] confirm..."

### Academic Tone Requirements

- Maintain objective, analytical perspective
- Support claims with evidence and reasoning

### Paragraph Guidelines

{% if previous_context %}
### Continuity Requirements
- Reference and build upon concepts from previous chapters where relevant
- Do NOT repeat content already covered - advance the discussion
- Maintain consistent terminology and tone
- Connect new material to the thesis statement
{% else %}
### First Chapter Requirements
- Establish the research context and significance
- Introduce key terminology that will be used throughout
- Set up the analytical framework for the paper
- Preview what will be covered in subsequent chapters
{% endif %}

## Output Format

Write the complete chapter content in markdown format. Include:
- All sections listed above with proper depth
- Well-developed paragraphs (no bullet point lists as main content)
- Embedded figure/table/chart descriptions in [FIGURE/TABLE/CHART] format
- Citations in [AuthorYear] format
- Use #### for subsection headers within sections

Do NOT include the chapter title header - start directly with the content.

**REMINDER: This chapter must be approximately {{ target_words }} words. Write comprehensively and thoroughly!**
