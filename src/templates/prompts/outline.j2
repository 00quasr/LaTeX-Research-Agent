## Your Task

Create a COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED outline for this research paper. This is a SUBSTANTIAL academic work requiring depth and rigor.

### Outline Structure Requirements

1. **Title**: Finalize the paper title (should be specific and scholarly)

2. **Abstract Summary**: A brief 3-4 sentence summary for the abstract

3. **Sections**: Create 7-12 major sections with EXTENSIVE subsections:
   - Section ID (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Section title
   - Purpose of the section
   - Target word count (be generous - this is a long paper)
   - Subsections (3-5 per section) with:
     - Subsection ID (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
     - Title
     - Key points to cover (5-8 detailed bullet points each)
     - Target word count (minimum 800-1500 words per subsection)
     - Suggested figures/tables/charts where applicable

### Required Structure

Your outline MUST include these core sections (expand each significantly):

1. **Introduction** (~{{ (target_words * 0.08) | int }} words)
   - Research context and motivation
   - Problem statement
   - Research objectives and questions
   - Scope and significance
   - Paper organization overview

2. **Background and Literature Review** (~{{ (target_words * 0.18) | int }} words)
   - Historical context
   - Theoretical frameworks
   - Current state of research
   - Key studies and findings
   - Research gaps

3. **Methodology/Approach** (~{{ (target_words * 0.10) | int }} words)
   - Research design
   - Data sources and collection
   - Analysis methods
   - Limitations and assumptions

4. **Main Analysis Sections** (3-5 sections, ~{{ (target_words * 0.45) | int }} words combined)
   - Each addressing a major theme or research question
   - Include subsections for different aspects
   - Suggest relevant figures, tables, charts for each
   - Provide detailed analysis with evidence

5. **Discussion** (~{{ (target_words * 0.12) | int }} words)
   - Synthesis of findings
   - Implications (theoretical and practical)
   - Comparison with existing literature
   - Limitations of the study
   - Recommendations

6. **Conclusion** (~{{ (target_words * 0.07) | int }} words)
   - Summary of key findings
   - Main contributions
   - Future research directions
   - Closing remarks

### Visual Elements to Suggest

For each relevant subsection, suggest:
- **Figures**: Diagrams, flowcharts, conceptual models
- **Tables**: Comparison tables, data summaries, timelines
- **Charts**: Graphs, bar charts, trend lines, pie charts
- **Infographics**: Process flows, relationship maps

### Word Count Guidelines

- Total words should sum to approximately {{ target_words }}
- Each subsection should be substantial (800-1500 words minimum)
- Main analysis sections should be the bulk of the paper
- Do NOT create superficial or thin sections

### Quality Standards

Ensure the outline is:
- Logically structured with clear progression of ideas
- Comprehensive in coverage of the topic
- Academically rigorous for {{ level }} level
- Properly balanced between sections
- Includes enough depth for a {{ target_pages }}-page paper
- Contains suggested visualizations for data and concepts
