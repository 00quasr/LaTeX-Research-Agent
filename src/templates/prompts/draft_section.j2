## Your Assignment

Write the following section with SUBSTANTIAL depth and detail:

**Section**: {{ section.id }} - {{ section.title }}
{% if subsection %}
**Subsection**: {{ subsection.id }} - {{ subsection.title }}

**Key Points to Cover** (develop each thoroughly):
{% for point in subsection.key_points %}
- {{ point }}
{% endfor %}

{% if subsection.suggested_figures %}
**Suggested Visual Elements**:
{% for fig in subsection.suggested_figures %}
- {{ fig }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**Target Word Count**: {{ subsection.target_words }} words (MINIMUM - aim higher)
{% else %}
**Purpose**: {{ section.purpose }}
**Target Word Count**: {{ section.target_words }} words (MINIMUM - aim higher)
{% endif %}

## Writing Requirements

- **Academic Level**: {{ level }}
- **Language**: {{ language }}
- **Citation Style**: {{ citation_style }}

## Previous Sections Context

{% if previous_sections %}
The following sections have already been written. Ensure continuity and build upon them:

{% for prev in previous_sections %}
### {{ prev.section_id }} - {{ prev.title }}
{{ prev.content[:800] }}{% if prev.content|length > 800 %}...{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
This is the first section being drafted.
{% endif %}

## CRITICAL Instructions for Comprehensive Writing

### Length and Depth Requirements
- **MINIMUM {{ subsection.target_words if subsection else section.target_words }} words** - this is a floor, not a ceiling
- Each key point should be developed into 2-4 substantial paragraphs
- Do NOT be superficial - this is a comprehensive academic paper
- Include detailed explanations, examples, and analysis

### Content Structure
1. **Opening**: Strong topic paragraph introducing the section's focus
2. **Development**: Each key point gets thorough treatment:
   - Explain the concept/idea in detail
   - Provide specific examples or case studies
   - Include relevant data, statistics, or research findings
   - Analyze implications and connections
3. **Transitions**: Smooth connections between paragraphs and ideas
4. **Closing**: Summarize key takeaways and transition to next section

### Visual Element Descriptions
When suggesting figures, tables, or charts, include:
- **[FIGURE X: Title]** - Description of what the figure shows
- **[TABLE X: Title]** - Description of table contents and structure
- **[CHART X: Title]** - Description of data visualization

Example:
[FIGURE 1: Evolution of Techno Music Production Technology]
A timeline diagram showing the progression from analog synthesizers (1980s) through digital audio workstations (1990s) to modern AI-assisted production tools (2020s). Key milestones include the Roland TR-808, Ableton Live's introduction, and neural audio synthesis.

### Citation Guidelines
- Include citations in format [AuthorYear] throughout
- Cite sources for statistics, claims, and research findings
- Aim for 5-15 citations per subsection
- Examples:
  - "Research by [Smith2023] demonstrates that..."
  - "According to industry analysis [Johnson2022], the market grew by..."
  - "Several studies [Brown2021; Davis2022; Wilson2023] confirm..."

### Academic Tone Requirements
- Use formal, scholarly language appropriate for {{ level }} level
- Avoid colloquialisms and informal expressions
- Use discipline-specific terminology correctly
- Maintain objective, analytical perspective
- Support claims with evidence and reasoning

### Paragraph Guidelines
- Each paragraph: 100-200 words
- Clear topic sentence
- Supporting evidence and analysis
- Concluding sentence that transitions

{% endif %}

## Output Format

Write the section content in markdown format. Include:
- Well-developed paragraphs (no bullet point lists as main content)
- Embedded figure/table/chart descriptions in [FIGURE/TABLE/CHART] format
- Citations in [AuthorYear] format
- Proper subsection headers if subdividing further (use #### for sub-subsections)

Do NOT include the section title - just write the content directly.

**Remember: This must be AT LEAST {{ subsection.target_words if subsection else section.target_words }} words. Write comprehensively!**
