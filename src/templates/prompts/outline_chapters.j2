## Your Task

Create a CHAPTER-BASED outline for this research paper. This structure enables sequential drafting where each chapter builds on the previous ones.

### CRITICAL: Chapter Structure Requirements

Each chapter must be **self-contained and approximately {{ words_per_chapter }} words** to fit within processing limits.

1. **Title**: Finalize the paper title (should be specific and scholarly)

2. **Abstract Summary**: A brief 3-4 sentence summary for the abstract

3. **Chapters**: Create {{ num_chapters }} chapters, each containing:
   - Chapter ID (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Chapter title (descriptive, academic)
   - Target word count (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words per chapter)
   - 1-3 sections within the chapter, with:
     - Section ID (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
     - Section title
     - Purpose of the section
     - Key points to cover (3-5 detailed bullet points)
     - Suggested figures/tables/charts where applicable

### Required Chapter Structure

Your outline MUST follow this logical progression:

**Chapter 1: Introduction** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Research context and motivation
- Problem statement and significance
- Research objectives and questions
- Scope and paper organization

**Chapter 2: Background and Context** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Historical context
- Theoretical frameworks
- Key definitions and concepts

**Chapter 3: Literature Review Part 1** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Foundational research
- Major theoretical perspectives
- Key studies in the field

**Chapter 4: Literature Review Part 2** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Recent developments
- Competing viewpoints
- Research gaps identified

**Chapter 5: Methodology** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Research design and approach
- Data sources and collection methods
- Analysis framework
- Limitations and assumptions

**Chapters 6-{{ num_chapters - 2 }}: Main Analysis** (Multiple chapters, ~{{ words_per_chapter }} words each)
- Each chapter addresses a major theme or research question
- Include subsections for different aspects
- Suggest relevant figures, tables, charts
- Provide detailed analysis with evidence
- Build on previous chapters' findings

**Chapter {{ num_chapters - 1 }}: Discussion** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Synthesis of findings
- Implications (theoretical and practical)
- Comparison with existing literature
- Recommendations

**Chapter {{ num_chapters }}: Conclusion** (~{{ words_per_chapter }} words)
- Summary of key findings
- Main contributions
- Future research directions
- Closing remarks

### Visual Elements to Suggest

For each relevant section, suggest:
- **Figures**: Diagrams, flowcharts, conceptual models
- **Tables**: Comparison tables, data summaries, timelines
- **Charts**: Graphs, bar charts, trend lines, pie charts

### Chapter Guidelines

- Each chapter is written SEQUENTIALLY, with context from previous chapters
- Keep chapters self-contained but interconnected
- Total words should sum to approximately {{ target_words }}
- Each chapter targets ~{{ words_per_chapter }} words (max 3500 words)
- Do NOT create thin or superficial chapters

### Quality Standards

Ensure the outline is:
- Logically structured with clear progression of ideas
- Comprehensive in coverage of the topic
- Academically rigorous for {{ level }} level
- Properly balanced between chapters
- Includes enough depth for a {{ target_pages }}-page paper
- Contains suggested visualizations for data and concepts

## Output Format

Return a structured outline with:
- title: The paper title
- abstract_summary: 3-4 sentence summary
- chapters: List of chapters, each containing:
  - id: Chapter number
  - title: Chapter title
  - target_words: Word count target (~{{ words_per_chapter }})
  - sections: List of sections with id, title, purpose, key_points, suggested_figures
- total_estimated_words: Sum of all chapter targets
