## Your Task

Perform a comprehensive coherence pass. CRITICAL: **Do NOT shorten the paper.** The goal is to ENHANCE and POLISH, not reduce.

### 1. Preserve and Enhance Length
- **DO NOT remove content** - only improve it
- **DO NOT summarize or condense** sections
- If sections seem short, EXPAND them with additional analysis
- Target output: {{ target_words }} words minimum
- Add transitional paragraphs between sections if needed

### 2. Structural Coherence
- Ensure smooth transitions between ALL sections
- Add bridging paragraphs where needed
- Verify logical flow of arguments throughout
- Check that thesis is consistently supported

### 3. Visual Elements Processing
Convert all [FIGURE], [TABLE], [CHART] descriptions to proper LaTeX-ready format:

For figures, output:
```
[FIGURE: figure_id]
Caption: Detailed caption text
Description: Full description of what the figure shows
```

For tables, output:
```
[TABLE: table_id]
Caption: Table caption
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
```

For charts, output:
```
[CHART: chart_id]
Caption: Chart caption
Type: bar/line/pie/scatter
Data: Description of data points and trends
```

### 4. Content Quality
- Eliminate repetition (but NOT length)
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Verify all claims are properly supported with citations
- Check that all research questions are thoroughly addressed
- Expand any superficial sections

### 5. Academic Style
- Ensure consistent formal academic tone throughout
- Fix any informal or colloquial language
- Standardize citation format to [AuthorYear]
- Ensure proper paragraph structure

### 6. Abstract (150-300 words)
Write a comprehensive abstract that:
- States the research problem and significance
- Describes the methodology/approach
- Summarizes key findings (be specific)
- States the main conclusions and implications
- Mentions contributions to the field

### 7. Final Polish
- Fix grammatical issues
- Ensure paragraph lengths are appropriate (100-200 words each)
- Verify section proportions are balanced
- Add any missing transitions

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **title**: The final paper title
2. **abstract**: Complete abstract text (150-300 words)
3. **body**: The complete, polished paper body in markdown format
   - Keep ALL content from original sections
   - Include processed visual element descriptions
   - Maintain full depth and length
4. **word_count**: Total word count of the body (should be ~{{ target_words }} or more)
5. **sections_count**: Number of main sections

## CRITICAL REMINDER

This is a {{ target_pages }}-page paper (~{{ target_words }} words). The output MUST be comprehensive and detailed. Do NOT condense or summarize. ENHANCE and POLISH while preserving length.

The final body should be publication-ready academic content with:
- Detailed analysis in every section
- Proper citations throughout
- Visual element descriptions
- Smooth transitions
- Professional academic tone
